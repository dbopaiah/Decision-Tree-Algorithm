# Decision-Tree
### Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
   The Python code for a Decision-Tree ([*Decision_tree.ipynb*](/Decision_tree.ipynb?raw=true)) is an example on how a basic machine learning algorithm works. 
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
Data can be found at [*Iris.csv*](/Iris.csv?raw=true)
